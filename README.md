An Addition/Multiplication app, using user input to display products/sums.
This project was made throughout the month of late May to early June 
It uses five, fully functional screens to filter information.
Specifically, using your or user input of two numbers to be multiplied or added.

The first screen or the first class, is displayed when the app is ran.
The MainActivity class displays two options for the user to choose.
This is shown through two buttons and two images, indicating the math symbols.
With the first option, ADDITION, if the user clicks this button, it will take them to the second screen or second class.

Otherwise known as, SecondActivity/SecondScreen.
This screen shows two text boxes for the user to input two individual numbers to add.
There are three buttons to navigate through different things, to add the numbers, go back to the previous screen, and document your input/output nums.
The ADD button is self explanatory, as it adds the two user inputted numbers.
The BACK button takes the user to the previous page.
The HISTORY button takes you to a new screen, the fourth screen or FourthActivity class. 
This activity can log any, but preferably numbers you have used to add.

If the user were to press the second option, it will take them to the third screen or ThirdActivity class.
This screen also shows two text boxes for the user to input two individual numbers to multiply instead.
There are three buttons aswell to navigate through different things, to multiply, go back to the previous screen, and document inputs/outputs.
Once again, these buttons have the same functionality as the SecondActivity class.

Even though this app is mainly functional, it still has some drawbacks.
Firstly, the list to document inputs and outputs is continous, you can not remove any item nor change it.
The list stays even when you exit the app and re-run it.
Secondly, when adding/multiplying, you can not input negative numbers or anything other than a positive numbers.
THe app will just crash. Entirely.
Enjoy adding and multiplying numbers with a limit of two. :D
